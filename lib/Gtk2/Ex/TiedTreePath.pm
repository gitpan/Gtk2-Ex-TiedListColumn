=head1 NAME

Gtk2::Ex::TiedTreePath - tie an array to a Gtk2::TreePath

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Gtk2::Ex::TiedTreePath;
 my $path = Gtk2::Path->new;

 my @array;
 tie @array, 'Gtk2::Ex::TiedTreePath', $path;

 my $aref = Gtk2::Ex::TiedTreePath->new ($path);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

TiedTreePath ties a Perl array to a C<Gtk2::TreePath> object so that reading
and writing the array acts on the indices making up the path.

Like most C<tie> things, TiedTreePath is probably better in concept than
actuality.  Being able to store to individual elements is handy, as are Perl
operations like push and pop, but a native C<Gtk2::TreePath> will suffice
for most uses.

=head2 C<delete> and C<exists>

A TreePath has no notion of "exists" on an array element.  If you C<delete>
an element in the middle of the array then it's cleared to 0, but C<exists>
is still true, unlike an ordinary perl array where C<exists> is false in
that case.  The tied C<exists> method simply checks whether the given index
is within the number of indices in the path.

Deleting the endmost element of a TiedTreePath works the same as an ordinary
array though.  In this case the TreePath is shortened with C<< $path->up >>
and C<exists> on that element is then false, being beyond the available
indices.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item C<tie @var, 'Gtk2::Ex::TiedTreePath', $path>

Tie array variable C<@var> to the given C<$path> (a C<Gtk2::TreePath>) so
C<@var> it accesses the path indices.

=item C<< $arrayref = Gtk2::Ex::TiedTreePath->new ($path) >>

Return an arrayref which is tied to C<$path>.  For example

    my $aref = Gtk2::Ex::TiedTreePath->new ($path);

is the same as

    tie (my @array, 'Gtk2::Ex::TiedTreePath', $path);
    my $aref = \@array;

If you want your own C<@array> as such then the plain C<tie> is easier.  If
you want an arrayref to pass around to other funcs then C<new> saves a line
of code.

=back

=head2 Object Methods

The tie object associated with the array (as returned by the C<tie> or
obtained later with C<tied>) has the following methods.

=over 4

=item C<< $path = $tobj->path >>

Return the underlying C<Gtk2::TreePath> object.  Eg.

    my @array;
    tie @array, 'Gtk2::Ex::TiedTreePath', $path;
    ...
    my $tobj = tied(@array);
    print $tobj->path->to_string;

Or likewise through an arrayref

    my $aref = Gtk2::Ex::TiedTreePath->new($path);
    ...
    my $path = tied(@$aref)->path;
